# SpaceGame

This is a game in which you pilot a spaceship through a field of asteroids, and then battle an enemy spaceship. Move the spaceship by moving your mouse and fire your weapons by clicking the mouse. A powerup you can collect during the game is an orbiter, which will orbit your ship and fire its weapons along with it.
